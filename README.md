MY README

1) My goal for the website was to create a way for users to save lists of their favoite meals and then have the ability to click a button and have the website randomly pick one of the meals.  

The origin for my idea was my 12 year old daughter.  During the week when I would help her get ready for school, she would often have trouble deciding  what she wanted for breakfest or lunch.  My hope is that this program would provide a fun way to help her decide.  

In developing this idea, I also thought this website could also be a fun way for anyone to chose what they want to eat for a certain meal.  There are many times when people incluing myself would like a fun way to help them decide what to eat.

3)  It is fun to be able to come up with different ideas for a website, but I find it difficult to design and plan the way single page websites should look, and to use modals and plan what information should be inside each modal.  

This was the first time I have ever had to plan out the back end of a website.  I thought it was a pretty cool process, and I would like to try a more challenging project with additional tables.  

I liked learning about the model view controller and the rails application framework including the different parts, like routers, controllers, schema, models

4) FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS-

1) My original concept for this website was to create a "wheel of food".  I wanted to make a graphical interface where users would be able to spin a wheel of food where each section of the wheel would be a different meal, kind of like a roulette wheel.

Going forward I would like to be able to add aditional tables to the database.  It would be great for people to be able to use the program to pick a desert, a beverage, or even have a list of their favorite restaurants, and be able to randomly pick one.  This would require people to be able to add their own custom charts.
